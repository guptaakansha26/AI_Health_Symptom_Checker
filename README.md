🩺 AI Health Symptom Checker

AI Health Symptom Checker is an intelligent system that analyzes user-input symptoms and predicts possible health conditions using machine learning. It’s designed to provide quick preliminary insights while guiding users toward professional healthcare consultation.

🌟 Key Features

Symptom-Based Prediction: Users can enter symptoms and receive possible health condition predictions.

High Accuracy ML Model: Uses supervised machine learning algorithms trained on a structured dataset for reliable predictions.

Interactive Interface: Clean, user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit or Flask.

Data Visualization: Displays symptom analysis trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Scalable and Extensible: Easy to integrate with additional health datasets or APIs for enhanced accuracy.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming: Python 3.x

Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Web Framework: Streamlit / Flask

Data Storage: CSV / SQL (depending on implementation)

Visualization & Dashboards: Matplotlib, Seaborn, optionally Power BI for extended analytics.

📊 Dataset

Trained on a structured dataset mapping symptoms to health conditions.

Dataset preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalization.

📈 Model & Methodology

Utilizes supervised learning models such as Random Forests, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.

Features: symptom presence, severity, and demographic data (if available).

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

Future scope: Integrate deep learning models, larger datasets, and symptom severity scoring.

🔮 Future Enhancements
